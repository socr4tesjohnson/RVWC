            <div class="q">Do I need a referral to be seen?</div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="q">What should I bring to my first visit?</div>

            <div class="a">Healing time varies based on the type of wound, circulation, infection, blood sugar control, and other health conditions. At your evaluation, we will review your specific situation and outline realistic expectations for healing.</div>
          </div>

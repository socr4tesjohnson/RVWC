          <p class="subtitle">
            Most minor cuts heal on their own, but some wounds need the expertise of a dedicated wound care team to avoid
            infection, reduce complications, and protect your mobility.

          Specialized wound care brings together medical evaluation, advanced dressings, and treatments that help your body
          heal. If you notice any of the warning signs below, call our clinic to get ahead of problems before they escalate.
        </p>

        <h2>1. The wound is not improving after 2&ndash;3 weeks</h2>
        <p>
          Healthy wounds typically shrink and look better over time. If your wound looks the same &mdash; or worse &mdash; after
          two to three weeks, it may be stalled. Slow healing can be related to circulation problems, diabetes, smoking,
          certain medications, or repeated pressure on the area. A wound specialist can identify the cause and create a plan
          to restart healing.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Pain, redness, or swelling keeps increasing</h2>
        <p>
          Some soreness is expected in the first few days, but pain should gradually fade. If discomfort intensifies, or if
          you see spreading redness and swelling, the wound could be inflamed or infected. These changes are a signal to get
          professional attention before tissue damage worsens.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Drainage is heavy, cloudy, or smells bad</h2>
        <p>
          Clear, light drainage can be normal. Thick, yellow, green, or foul-smelling drainage is not. A sudden increase in
          fluid, especially if dressings are soaked through, can also indicate infection or a deeper issue such as a
          developing abscess. Bring these changes to a wound care specialist quickly so treatment can begin.
        </p>

        <h2>4. You notice fever, chills, or streaking</h2>
        <p>
          Systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or red streaks moving away from the wound suggest the infection may be
          spreading. This situation can become serious quickly. Seek care right away so a clinician can evaluate the wound,
          order cultures if needed, and start appropriate antibiotics or advanced therapies.
        </p>

        <h2>5. You have risk factors that slow healing</h2>
        <p>
          People with diabetes, circulation problems, neuropathy, weakened immune systems, or limited mobility face extra
          challenges when healing. Even small wounds can progress to ulcers or infections. A specialized wound clinic can
          offload pressure, manage blood flow concerns, and monitor for early complications to protect your health.

          <h2>Comprehensive wound care for a range of diagnoses</h2>
          <p class="intro">We focus on chronic and complex wounds that are not healing as expected. Our goal is to protect function, manage infection, and support long-term healing.</p>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Diabetic foot ulcers</h3>
            <p>Ulcers on the feet of people with diabetes can lead to serious infection and amputation if not treated early. We focus on off-loading pressure, controlling infection, and protecting blood flow.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Venous leg ulcers</h3>
            <p>Caused by poor vein circulation, these ulcers often appear around the ankles and lower legs. Treatment may include compression, advanced dressings, and lifestyle guidance.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Arterial ulcers</h3>
            <p>Wounds caused by narrowed or blocked arteries require careful evaluation. We coordinate closely with vascular specialists to protect tissue and improve blood flow where possible.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Pressure injuries (bedsores)</h3>
            <p>Pressure injuries occur when skin and tissue are damaged from prolonged pressure, often in patients with limited mobility. We provide staging, pressure-relief strategies, and wound care plans.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Surgical & post-operative wounds</h3>
            <p>Some surgical incisions do not heal as expected due to infection, tension, or circulation problems. We help manage these wounds to support closure and prevent complications.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Traumatic wounds</h3>
            <p>Lacerations, skin tears, and soft-tissue injuries may need specialized dressings, debridement, or follow-up care. We work to protect function and minimize scarring.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Infected wounds</h3>
            <p>Infections can slow healing and, in severe cases, threaten limb or life. We assess wounds for signs of infection and coordinate antibiotics and advanced therapies when needed.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Other non-healing wounds</h3>
            <p>If your wound has not improved after several weeks of standard care, a focused wound care evaluation may help identify underlying issues and provide new treatment options.</p>

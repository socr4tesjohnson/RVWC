        <p>
          Small cuts and blisters can become serious problems when you have diabetes. Elevated blood sugar affects blood
          vessels, nerves, and immune responses, so the body has a harder time fighting infection and rebuilding tissue. Even
          minor injuries on the feet or lower legs can turn into chronic wounds without early intervention.
        </p>

        <h2>Why diabetes slows the healing process</h2>
        <p>
          Several diabetes-related changes make wounds slower to close:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-check">
          <li><strong>High blood sugar impairs immunity.</strong> Elevated glucose weakens white blood cells, so infections develop faster and are harder to control.</li>
          <li><strong>Poor circulation reduces oxygen delivery.</strong> Diabetes can damage blood vessels, limiting the oxygen and nutrients tissues need to rebuild.</li>
          <li><strong>Neuropathy hides warning signs.</strong> Nerve damage diminishes pain and temperature sensation, so you may not notice a blister or cut until it worsens.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure points break down skin.</strong> Changes in foot shape or gait increase friction, causing calluses and ulcers that can deepen with walking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common wound risks for people with diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          Foot ulcers are the most frequent diabetes-related wounds. They often begin with a callus or small break in the skin
          that goes unnoticed because of neuropathy. Reduced blood flow slows healing, allowing bacteria to spread and
          sometimes leading to bone infection (osteomyelitis). Wounds on the shins or heels can also stall if shoes rub or if
          swelling limits circulation.
        </p>

        <h2>Red flags that need immediate attention</h2>
        <p>
          Contact a wound care specialist promptly if you notice:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-check">
          <li>A sore that is not smaller after 1&ndash;2 weeks</li>
          <li>Increasing redness, swelling, warmth, or odor</li>
          <li>Drainage that is thick, yellow, green, or bloody</li>
          <li>New numbness, tingling, or pain around the wound</li>
          <li>Fever, chills, or red streaks moving up the leg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to protect your feet and skin</h2>
        <p>
          Daily habits make a big difference in preventing ulcers:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-check">
          <li>Inspect your feet every day for blisters, cracks, or color changes. Use a mirror or ask for help if needed.</li>
          <li>Wash and dry thoroughly, especially between toes, and moisturize dry skin to prevent cracks.</li>
          <li>Wear well-fitted shoes and cushioned socks; avoid walking barefoot.</li>
          <li>Trim nails straight across and file sharp edges to avoid accidental cuts.</li>
          <li>Work with your clinician to keep blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol within target ranges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What specialized wound care can do</h2>

          Wound care visits are collaborative: you bring your story and goals, and we bring advanced techniques to help your
          body heal. Here’s what typically happens during an appointment at River Valley Wound Care.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Check-in and paperwork</h2>
        <p>
          Arrive a few minutes early with your ID, insurance card, and a list of medications or allergies. New patients fill
          out a brief health history so we understand your medical background and any factors that might affect healing such
          as diabetes, circulation issues, or mobility challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nurse assessment and vital signs</h2>
        <p>
          A nurse will escort you to a private room, review your history, and take vital signs. We’ll ask about the wound’s
          origin, how you’ve been caring for it, and any changes you’ve noticed. Photos or previous care instructions are
          helpful if you have them.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Wound evaluation by your clinician</h2>
        <p>
          Your provider measures the wound, checks blood flow, and looks for signs of infection or pressure. They may gently
          clean the area to see healthy tissue and determine whether procedures such as debridement, offloading, or advanced
          dressings are needed.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Personalized treatment plan</h2>
        <p>
          After the exam, we outline a plan tailored to your needs. This often includes dressing recommendations, pressure
          relief strategies, nutrition guidance, and coordination with your primary care provider or specialists. We’ll answer
          your questions so you feel confident about next steps.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Treatment performed in the clinic</h2>
        <p>
          When needed, we perform debridement (removing dead tissue), apply advanced dressings, or fit devices to reduce
          pressure on the wound. Our goal is to create the best environment for healing while keeping you comfortable.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Education and home care instructions</h2>
        <p>
          You’ll receive detailed guidance on how to change dressings, when to keep the area dry, and warning signs to watch
          for at home. If supplies are required, we’ll explain how to obtain them and demonstrate proper techniques before you
          leave.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Scheduling follow-up visits</h2>
        <p>
          Most wounds benefit from regular monitoring. We’ll schedule follow-up appointments to track progress, adjust
          treatment, and coordinate any imaging or labs that support your healing plan.
